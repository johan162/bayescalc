# Simplified insurance BN: demographics & car features influence accidents then damage & medical costs (medium-scale dependency structure).
# Insurance Bayesian Network (Reduced - 10 variables)
# This is a simplified version of the Insurance network for testing
# 
# PURPOSE:
# Models key factors that influence car insurance costs and claims.
# Considers demographics, driving behavior, vehicle characteristics, and accident scenarios.
#
# VARIABLES (10 total):
# Demographics: Age, SocioEcon, GoodStudent
# Vehicle: MakeModel, CarValue, Antilock, Airbag
# Accidents: Accident, ThisCarDam
# Costs: MedCost

# Variable declarations (boolean variables implied)
variables: Age, SocioEcon, GoodStudent, MakeModel,CarValue,Antilock,Airbag,Accident,ThisCarDam,MedCost
