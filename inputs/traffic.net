# Traffic delay network: RushHour and Accident raise Traffic which drives Late arrival; shows converging and downstream causal effects.
# Traffic Network (5-variable causal BN)
# Structure:
#   RushHour -> {Accident, Traffic}
#   Accident -> Traffic
#   Traffic -> Late
# Illustrates: converging influences on Traffic (a v-structure at Traffic if we had another parent),
# and sequential causal propagation to Late. RushHour and Accident become dependent when
# conditioning on Traffic (a collider-like induced dependence if an additional parent existed).
# Probabilities (illustrative, not from a canonical dataset):
# P(RushHour=1)=0.6
# P(Accident=1|RushHour): RH=1 -> 0.05, RH=0 -> 0.01
# P(Traffic=1|RushHour,Accident):
#   RH A : P(T=1)
#   1  1 : 0.95
#   1  0 : 0.70
#   0  1 : 0.90
#   0  0 : 0.20
# P(Late=1|Traffic): T=1 -> 0.8, T=0 -> 0.1
# All variables binary with 1 representing the "positive" / named condition.
