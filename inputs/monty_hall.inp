# Monty Hall Problem (Simplified Boolean Representation)
# Classic puzzle: Three doors, one prize. Player picks a door. Host (knows prize) opens a different door showing a goat.
# Player can stick or switch. Switching wins with probability 2/3, staying wins with probability 1/3.
#
# Simplification here: We collapse the scenario to two boolean variables capturing the essence:
#   Hit        (H): 1 if the player's initial choice was the prize door, else 0.
#   SwitchWin  (W): 1 if switching would win, else 0. Deterministically W = 1 - H.
#
# With a uniformly random initial choice over 3 doors and a single prize door:
#   P(H=1) = 1/3,  P(H=0) = 2/3.
# Therefore: P(W=1) = 2/3, P(W=0) = 1/3.
#
# This minimal encoding emphasizes the conditional reasoning outcome without enumerating host strategy details.
# All logically impossible combinations (H=0,W=0) or (H=1,W=1) receive probability 0.
# Useful queries:
#   P(W)            -> 0.6667 (benefit of switching)
#   P(H)            -> 0.3333
#   IsIndep(H,W)    -> False (deterministic complement relationship)
#   entropy(H,W)    -> entropy(H) (since W determined by H)
variables: Hit, SwitchWin
00: 0.0        # Hit=0 (miss), SwitchWin=0 (impossible)
01: 0.6666667  # Hit=0, Switch would win
10: 0.3333333  # Hit=1, Switch would lose
11: 0.0        # Hit=1, SwitchWin=1 (impossible)
