# XOR Triplet Example (A, B, C) where C = A XOR B.
# Interesting because: A and B are independent; A and C are independent; B and C are independent;
# yet (A,B,C) are NOT mutually independent since C is a deterministic parity constraint linking A and B.
# Watch out: pairwise independence does NOT imply mutual independence.
variables: A, B, C
000: 0.25   # A=0,B=0 => C must be 0
011: 0.25   # A=0,B=1 => C=1
101: 0.25   # A=1,B=0 => C=1
110: 0.25   # A=1,B=1 => C=0
