# Student performance BN: Intelligence & Difficulty influence Prep and Grade; Grade drives Letter recommendation (multi-valued academic model).
# Student Performance Bayesian Network (5 variables, multi-valued)
# Inspired by classic "Student" BN variant.
# Variables:
#   Intelligence {Low, Medium, High}
#   Difficulty   {Easy, Medium, Hard}
#   Prep         {Poor, Adequate, Good}
#   Grade        {C, B, A}
#   Letter       {Strong, Weak}
# Structure:
#   Intelligence -> Prep
#   Difficulty -> Grade
#   Intelligence -> Grade
#   Prep -> Grade
#   Grade -> Letter

variable Intelligence {Low, Medium, High}
variable Difficulty {Easy, Medium, Hard}
